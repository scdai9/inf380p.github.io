# First Reflection- INF

* **What’s a lightbulb that has gone on for you? Give an example.**
The *function* can help me reduce the redundant code when I was trying to use Turtle to draw some shapes. I found that I could wrap the statement into a function so that I did not need to copy and paste the same statement for drawing several shapes. 

Here is the old version

The *function* can make my code shorter and easier to read.
* **Describe some confusion you’ve experienced. Did it help you learn?**
In the beginning, I felt confused about whether the turtle moved with a trajectory or not. After discussion with my group mate, I found that there are two functions *penup()* and *pendown()* to control that.
* **What’s still fuzzy for you? What will you do to make sure you can resolve your fuzziness?**
I sometimes experienced indentation errors, and I realized that was because I mixed the tab and spaces. What I learned to solve this issue is consistently using spaces.
* **What problem solving strategies have been working for you? Give an example.**
I will break down the problem. For example, in the exercise of the textbook, there is an over speed question. In that question, we have to design a program that can determine the fine for over speed. Moreover, if is_birthday, the driver can have more 5 miles for over speed. What I did was focus on the normal situation (is_birthday = False) and then deal with the special condition (is_birthday = True)
